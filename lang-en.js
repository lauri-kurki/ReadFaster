This app will help you read faster than ever before.\n\nThe technique you are about to learn is called RSVP, which stands for Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Instead of moving your eyes across lines of text, words come to you one at a time, right in the center of your screen.\n\nNotice the letter highlighted in red. This is called the Optimal Recognition Point, or ORP. Your brain processes words fastest when your eyes focus on this specific letter, usually about one third into the word.\n\nBy keeping the ORP in exactly the same position for every word, your eyes never need to move. This eliminates the time wasted on eye movements, allowing you to read much faster.\n\nMost people read around 200 to 250 words per minute. With practice, you can easily double or triple that speed. Some readers reach 600 words per minute or more while maintaining excellent comprehension.\n\nStart with slower speeds to get comfortable. As you progress through the training levels, the speed will increase gradually. Do not worry if it feels fast at first. Your brain will adapt quickly.\n\nReady to begin? Complete this text to unlock the next level. Good luck on your speed reading journey!"

At its center sits the Sun, a massive ball of hot plasma that provides the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\nEight planets orbit the Sun. The four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are small and rocky. They are called the terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces.\n\nBeyond Mars lies the asteroid belt, a region filled with rocky debris left over from the formation of the solar system. Past the asteroids are the four outer planets, also known as the gas giants.\n\nJupiter is the largest planet, so massive that all other planets could fit inside it. Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, cold and distant worlds with thick atmospheres.\n\nAt the edge of our solar system lies the Kuiper Belt, home to dwarf planets like Pluto. Even farther out is the Oort Cloud, a theoretical shell of icy objects that marks the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space.\n\nScientists continue to explore our cosmic neighborhood using telescopes and spacecraft. Each new discovery reveals more about the universe we call home."

            content: "The art of strategy is of vital importance. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it demands careful study.\n\nAll warfare is based on deception. When able to attack, we must seem unable. When using our forces, we must seem inactive. When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.\n\nThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Thus the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting. He captures cities without laying siege. He overthrows kingdoms without lengthy operations in the field.\n\nKnow yourself and know your enemy, and in a hundred battles you will never be in peril. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in danger in every battle.\n\nSpeed is the essence of strategy. Take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness. Travel by unexpected routes. Strike where the enemy has not anticipated.\n\nThese principles have guided leaders for thousands of years. They apply not only to warfare but to business, sports, and the challenges of everyday life."

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world have not had the advantages that you have had.\n\nThat summer I had just arrived in the East, nervous and excited. I rented a small house in the village of West Egg, on that slender island which extends itself due east of New York. My house was at the very tip of the egg, squeezed between two huge mansions.\n\nThe one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual imitation of some castle in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and so it had been overlooked.\n\nAcross the courtesy bay, the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water. The history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with some old friends.\n\nIt was then that I first glimpsed my mysterious neighbor. He was standing alone on his lawn, gazing at a single green light across the water. What that light meant to him, I would only discover much later."

Somewhere down there, among millions of lights and lives, her future waited.\n\nShe had exactly twelve hours left. Twelve hours before the shuttle departed, before Earth became nothing more than a blue dot in the window of her cabin. Mars colony applications took three years to process, she remembered. Three years of waiting, hoping, wondering if she had made the right choice.\n\nThe coffee machine hummed to life as she approached the kitchen. Her grandmother's photograph sat on the shelf, faded but precious. What would she think of all this? A granddaughter leaving the only planet humanity had ever known, chasing dreams across the void of space.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Messages from friends, family, colleagues. Some wished her luck. Others asked her to reconsider. One simply said goodbye. She read each one carefully, letting the words sink in.\n\nOutside, the rain had stopped. Sunlight broke through the clouds, painting the wet streets gold. The city had never looked more beautiful than in this moment of leaving it behind.\n\nMaya smiled and began to pack. Some journeys, she realized, are worth taking alone. Some dreams are worth the distance they demand. Today was not an ending. It was a beginning."

It originated in Ethiopia, where legend says a goat herder named Kaldi discovered it after noticing his goats became energetic after eating certain berries. The beans are actually seeds from the coffee cherry fruit. Today, Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. Coffee contains caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system and can improve focus and alertness. Most people drink coffee in the morning to help wake up, though some prefer it throughout the day. The two main types of coffee beans are Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are considered higher quality and have a smoother taste, while Robusta beans are stronger and contain more caffeine.",
